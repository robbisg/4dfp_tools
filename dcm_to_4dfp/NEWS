What are all these extra files (including, for example, NEWS)?  Most
are support for the GNU autotools, which is a (reasonably) portable
package for automatically generating Makefiles and handling various
system dependencies.

See INSTALL for how to use them.

If you got these files directly from Git, you'll need to do a little
bit of setup before you can run "configure".  Do the following:

aclocal
autoheader
automake -a
autoconf

and then you can follow the instructions in INSTALL.
