This dicom to 4dfp conversion program is modified from the fine work
of the Electronic Radiology Lab, Washington University School of
Medicine, and Stephen M. Moore. Please respect their copyright
notices. At this time it should be used with caution. Further testing
is needed. The basic program was a dicom to 16 bit analyze image
conversion. Functions for producing 4dfp volume data have been
added. A rec file and an ifh file are written.

The file sorting algorithm creates a list of filenames and sorts them
into analyze volumes according to each file's Series Instance UID
(0020 000e), though an alternate volume-identifying tag may be chosen
with the -d option. The files within each volume are then sorted by
the relative image number (tag 0020 0013). Orientation is extracted
and a check for multivolume data is made. The volume is sorted once
more by image position (0020 0032) to verify compliance with the
4dfp-Analyze coordinate system. If every image has the same position
(bold), volume size is set to 1.

Distance between slices (dime.pixdim[3]) is determined
preferentially. The default is to use the slice spacing tag 0018
0088. The slice thickness 0018 0050 will then be used. User defined
values for slice spacing may be set using the -t switch. (e.g. -t 2.5
would override the slice thickness and spaceing between slices tags,
and place the value 2.5 in the hdr file and the "scaling factor
(mm/pixel) [3]." in the ifh header.) The -c option may be used to
calculate this value using relative image position tag 0020 0032 and
will override any -t options or defaults. If tags for slice thickness
and slice spacing do not exist, and -t option is not used, the program
default will use the relative image position to calculate the distance
between slices.

Pixel values may be signed or unsigned 16 bit integers.  Min and max
are found checking each pixel.

Command Line Options:

-b  Output base filename follows the -b. The default is - analyze - 
-d  Divide series by the header tag given by the group and element number.
    ** Default is Series Instance UID 0020 000e
-f  Directories will be created, and dicom files will be moved.
-g  Add XYZ slice position, image name and number to rec file.

-c		Slice Spacing: Compute space between slices. (ignore -t)
-q		Slice Spacing: Do not compute space between slices (** Default)
-t <flt>	Slice Spacing: Use input value [-t <flt>]
-t T		Slice Spacing: Use Slice Thickness 0018 0050.[-t T]
-t S		Slice Spacing: Use Slice Spacing 0018 0088 [-t S](** Default)

-u  Output files named using sequence tag 0018 0024 plus number.

Analyze Coordinate System is determined using Image Position (0020 0032).
Multivolume and BOLD images are ordered by REL Image Number (0020 0013).

Reverse The Analyze Coordinate System Using Relative Image Position:
(Multivolume and BOLD data will reverse image numbering (0020 0013).)
-X  X Sagittal image positions will be ordered high to low.
-Y  Y Coronal image positions will be low to high.
-Z  Z Transverse image positions will be high to low.
