/* DCM_Message
**
** Purpose:
**	Find the ASCIZ message that goes with an DCM error number and
**	return a pointer to static memory containing that error message.
**
** Parameter Dictionary:
**	condition	The error condition for which the message is to be
**			returned
**
** Return Values:
**	The error message if a valid error condition was reported else NULL.
**
** Algorithm:
**	Description of the algorithm (optional) and any other notes.
